        <div class="text">Kharif, also known as the "monsoon crop" in India, refers to the summer or wet season crop
            cultivation. Kharif crops are sown with the onset of the monsoon rains and are typically harvested in the
            autumn. These crops are well-suited to the rainy season and include a variety of staple foods and cash
            crops. Kharif crops play a crucial role in providing food and income for millions of people, especially in
            tropical and subtropical regions.
            In India, for example, Kharif crops are typically sown from June to July, coinciding with the arrival of the
            southwest monsoon. The exact timing may vary from one region to another, and it is essential for farmers to
            plant their crops during this period to take advantage of the seasonal rainfall.
