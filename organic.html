        <p><h2>Organic farming is an agricultural approach that focuses on sustainable and environmentally
            friendly practices to grow crops and raise livestock. It emphasizes the use of natural and non-synthetic
            methods to enhance soil fertility, manage pests and diseases, and promote the overall health of ecosystems.
            Organic farming is guided by specific principles and standards that vary by region and certification bodies
            but generally share common objectives:

            Soil Health: Organic farming places a strong emphasis on soil health. It aims to improve and maintain soil
            fertility through natural means, such as compost, organic matter, and crop rotation, while avoiding
            synthetic chemical fertilizers.

            Non-GMO and Natural Seeds: Organic farming typically relies on non-genetically modified (GMO) seeds and
            encourages the use of traditional and heirloom varieties.

            Pest and Disease Management: Organic farming promotes the use of integrated pest management (IPM)
            techniques, which include natural predators, crop rotation, and resistant plant varieties to control pests
            and diseases. The use of synthetic pesticides is restricted.

            Weed Control: Organic farming uses mechanical and manual methods for weed control, such as mulching, hand
            weeding, and flame weeding, to minimize the use of herbicides.

            Livestock Welfare: In organic animal agriculture, there are strict guidelines for the humane treatment of
            animals, including access to pasture, organic feed, and restrictions on the use of growth hormones and
            antibiotics.

            Crop Rotation: Crop rotation is a common practice in organic farming to break pest and disease cycles and
            maintain soil fertility.

            Biodiversity: Organic farms often encourage biodiversity through practices like planting cover crops,
            preserving natural habitats, and promoting beneficial insects and pollinators.

            Chemical and Synthetic Input Restrictions: The use of synthetic chemicals, antibiotics, synthetic growth
            hormones, and genetically modified organisms is generally prohibited or significantly restricted in organic
            farming.

            Organic Certification: Organic farms must adhere to specific standards and undergo third-party certification
            to label their products as "organic." Certification ensures compliance with organic principles and
            standards.

            Sustainability: Organic farming is based on principles of sustainability, with an emphasis on conserving
            natural resources, reducing environmental impact, and promoting long-term soil and ecosystem health.

            Consumer Health: Organic products are intended to provide consumers with food that is free from synthetic
            pesticides and chemicals, potentially reducing their exposure to harmful residues.

            Organic farming has gained popularity due to its focus on environmentally responsible practices and its
            perceived health benefits. Organic products are available in many markets and are identified by official
            organic labels or certifications, such as "USDA Organic" in the United States or "EU Organic" in Europe.
            While organic farming has its benefits, it also faces challenges, such as potentially lower yields and
            higher labor costs, which can make organic products more expensive. Nevertheless, it remains an important
            and growing sector in modern agriculture.
