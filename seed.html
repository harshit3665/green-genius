        <h2>In farming, a seed is the mature, fertilized ovule of a flowering plant, typically contained within a
            protective seed coat. Seeds are essential for plant reproduction and the establishment of new plants. Here
            are some key points about seeds in farming:

            Reproductive Structure: Seeds are the reproductive structures of plants. They contain the genetic
            information (embryo) necessary for the growth and development of a new plant.

            Seed Formation: Seeds develop from the fertilization of an egg cell within the ovule by pollen, typically
            from another flower of the same plant species. The fertilized ovule becomes the seed, while the surrounding
            ovary often develops into a fruit.

            Variety: Different plant species produce seeds with varying sizes, shapes, and characteristics. The type of
            seed produced depends on the plant species.

            Germination: Germination is the process by which a seed sprouts and grows into a new plant. It requires the
            right environmental conditions, including moisture, temperature, and oxygen.

            Plant Propagation: Seeds are a common method of propagating many crops and plants. They can be collected
            from mature plants and sown to produce new plants.

            Crop Cultivation: In agriculture, seeds are used to cultivate a wide variety of crops, including grains
            (e.g., wheat, rice, corn), vegetables (e.g., tomatoes, carrots, lettuce), fruits (e.g., apples, oranges),
            and legumes (e.g., beans, peas).

            Selection and Breeding: Farmers and plant breeders select and breed plants with desirable traits to produce
            seeds that are adapted to specific environmental conditions or that have improved characteristics like
            disease resistance, higher yields, or better taste.

            Seed Banks: Seed banks are facilities that store and preserve a wide range of plant seeds, especially those
            of endangered, rare, or valuable species. These banks are crucial for conserving biodiversity and genetic
            resources.

            Genetically Modified (GM) Seeds: Some crops are grown from genetically modified seeds that have been altered
            through biotechnology to express specific traits, such as resistance to pests or tolerance to herbicides.

            Seed Quality: Seed quality is essential for successful crop production. It includes factors like seed
            purity, germination rate, and freedom from diseases or contaminants.

            Sowing: Farmers sow seeds into the soil at the appropriate depth and spacing to ensure proper plant growth
            and development. Sowing can be done by hand or with specialized machinery, depending on the crop and scale
            of farming.

            In summary, seeds are fundamental to agriculture and are the starting point for the growth of plants that
            produce the food and crops essential for human sustenance and many industrial uses. The careful selection,
            preservation, and management of seeds are vital aspects of modern farming.
