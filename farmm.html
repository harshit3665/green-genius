        <p class="text">FARM MACHINERY</p>
        <p class="text">Farm machinery in crop production refers to the various mechanical equipment and devices used in
            agriculture to perform tasks related to growing, maintaining, and harvesting crops. These machines are
            essential for modern farming and significantly enhance the efficiency and productivity of crop production.
            Different types of farm machinery are employed at various stages of crop cultivation. Here are some common
            types of farm machinery used in crop production:

            Tractors: Tractors are versatile machines that serve as the power source for various implements and are used
            for tasks like plowing, tilling, planting, cultivating, and harvesting. They are the workhorse of many
            farms.

            Plows: Plows are used for turning over and breaking up the soil to prepare it for planting. Different types
            of plows, such as moldboard plows and disc plows, are used depending on the specific soil and crop.

            Seeders and Planters: These machines are used to sow seeds with precision, ensuring proper spacing and
            depth. They are commonly used for row crops like corn, soybeans, and cotton.

            Cultivators: Cultivators are used for weeding and aerating the soil, typically between rows of crops,
            helping to control weeds and maintain soil structure.

            Sprayers: Sprayers are used to apply pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, and other chemicals to crops. They
            come in various types, including boom sprayers and air-assisted sprayers.

            Harvesters: Harvesters are machines designed to efficiently gather crops, such as combines for grains and
            forage harvesters for silage and forage crops.

            Balers: Balers are used to compress and bundle crops like hay, straw, and silage into manageable and
            transportable units for storage or sale.

            Irrigation Equipment: Various irrigation systems, including drip irrigation, pivot systems, and sprinklers,
            are used to supply water to crops, especially in areas with insufficient rainfall.

            Fertilizer Spreaders: Fertilizer spreaders distribute fertilizers evenly across fields to provide essential
            nutrients to crops.

            Grain Handling and Storage Equipment: This includes grain silos, grain elevators, and grain conveyors used
            for storing and handling harvested grain.

            Haying Equipment: Haying equipment includes mowers, rakes, and hay conditioners used to harvest and process
            forage crops like hay and straw.

            Milling and Processing Equipment: These machines are used for processing and packaging agricultural
            products, such as flour mills, rice mills, and grain dryers.

            Truck and Trailer Equipment: Trucks and trailers are used to transport crops, livestock, and farm equipment.

            Tillage Equipment: These machines prepare the soil for planting by breaking up clods, leveling the ground,
            and creating seedbeds.

            Livestock Equipment: In cases where livestock are part of the farm, equipment such as feeding machinery,
            milking machines, and automated systems for livestock management are used.

            The selection of specific machinery depends on the type of crops grown, the scale of the operation, and the
            specific needs of the farm. Farm machinery has evolved over the years, incorporating advanced technologies,
            automation, and precision farming techniques to improve crop production and make agriculture more
            sustainable and efficient.
